# RC-I1 Assignment

This project for bug fixing . Don't worry, it's a very simplistic version.

## Development server

You will node and npm.
I suggest using node 18.0.0 and npm 8.6.0.
While other systems also work, I cannot provide the set of packages you will need right now.

Install the prerequisites with the command

```shell
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

The last step run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## The Tasks

1. Try to launch project
2. Find the main problem that handles this.
3. Propose a way to fix the behaviour
4. Implement.
5. Did you find (or can you think of) any other bugs? Test and describe what you found out.
6. Create a merge request with your changes on Gitlab.

Feel free to ask any questions.
